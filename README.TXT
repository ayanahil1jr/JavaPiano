PROJECT TITLE:
MyPiano

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the simulation of a digital piano on the Greenfoot platform, imparting interactivity to concepts such as sound synthesis, keyboard input handling, and user interface design. The intention being to gain deeper experience on event-driven programming and real-time audio feedback within an educational Java setting.

In developing a playable piano, this illustrates software linking user input to multimedia output and reinforcing notions such as collaboration of classes, object-oriented design, and custom key-mapping. Also, students will learn through a fun and intuitive process the fundamentals of digital music interfaces, which can be used for classroom demonstrations or personal enrichment.
